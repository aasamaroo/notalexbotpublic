This is my public repository for my Discord bot. 

It is the 2nd bot I made, and it does a variety of things. 

Most notably it is connected to a DB that has the names of restaurants, and the users can use the commands !addrestaurant, and !whattoeat to
add a restaurant to the DB, and randomly pick which one to eat at. 

Users can also use !restaurants to check which restaurants are in the DB.
